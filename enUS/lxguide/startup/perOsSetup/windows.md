## For Windows 7 User
In principle, updated features would not guarantee to work on Windows 7 after Windows 10 end of support as we expected. Same with Windows 8/8.1 one year after Windows 7. But LauncherX could still work on Windows 7(and laster version) as lone as the system framework supports. Addtional runtime and supporting software might be needed and LauncherX might not work without any wrong.

For example, LauncherX could run on Windows 10 (and older version) by manual install supporting lib and some **particular Windows update** (KB3118401)

* Windows 7: [Not Eng! 查看环境安装引导](/zhCN/lxguide/startup/others/win7)
* Windows 8/8.1: [Download Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3118401) from Official Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=51109)

Please note: LauncherX only support 64 bit archarchitecture! So that links provided only for 64 bitarchitecture.

Reboot the computer to make full effect of the update if nessessory.
